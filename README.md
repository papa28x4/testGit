## Contributing

This repo has 4 branches. `master`, `frontend`, `backend` and `develop`. The `master` branch shall remain untouched till we're ready for deployment. If you want to work on backend code, create your own branch from `backend` branch, work and make a Pull Request(This is very important. Always make pull requests). If you want to work on the frontend, do the same thing in `frontend` branch. When we want to test our app, we'll bring FE and BE code to `develop` and test. Then when we're satisfied with what is in `develop`, we'll merge to `master` and deploy. Please always include details of what you worked on in your commit and Pull Request messages. Also remember to `pull` first to update your local repo before working and making a PR.
